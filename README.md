# Mod Setup
#### Newest mods update: 20/06/2021
##### What doesn't work?
* Optifine Shaders
### Things to download
* [Fabric Loader](https://maven.fabricmc.net/net/fabricmc/fabric-installer/0.7.4/fabric-installer-0.7.4.jar)
* [Mods](https://github.com/martino-dot/martino-dot.github.io/raw/main/mods.zip)
### Things to note
* GOS currently runs 1.17 Fabric
* GOS is a private modded server
* Some mods are still not available for 1.17 Fabric and will not work
* Forge mods WILL NOT WORK with Fabric
* Other versions of the same mods may not work (sometimes even crashes your game!)
### Setting up mods
#### Installing fabric
* Download Fabric loader and run the jar. From there make sure that `Minecraft Version` is on 1.17, and click on `Install`.
* Once the Fabric laoder shows that it has been successfully installed you can close the Fabric installer.
* Run Fabric 1.17 (using the minecraft launcher) before proceeding to `installing mods`.
#### Installing mods
* Go to your mods folder (On Windows: Press 'Windows Key' + 'R', type in '%appdata%' and press run, click on .minecraft, then go to mods.
* Download the mods and extract the zip.
* Move all the mods you just extracted from the zip into the mods folder.
* (Info) If you have any forge mods in your mods folder then delete them or put them in a different folder.
### Getting Started
* Run Minecraft with Fabric 1.17 (VERY IMPORTANT)
* Make sure to set new keybinds by running Minecraft and going to options, and then controls
* Add the server using the ip that you have been provided with and join it
* You will see the screen (shown below) which you'll use to select your origin (if you don't remember check your Dicsord role or the #gos-origin-description channel)
![Origins menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martino-dot/martino-dot.github.io/main/Screenshot_2021-05-16_180222.png) 
* If your origin has a primary ability you press `G` to activiate it. Some origins have second ability which you'll have to set a keybind for (`H` is recommended)
![Keybinds](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martino-dot/martino-dot.github.io/main/Screenshot_2021-05-16_180823.png)
* After you choose an oriign, you'll be greated with a `Choose your Class` screen (as shown below). This is where you choose a class (classes aren't origins they make you better at a profession, palyers can choose the same class, but not the same class). Choose the one that seems most interesting to you.
### Setting up proximity chat
* Logon to the server
* Press `V` (default keybind) to open up the voice chat menu (as shown below)
![Voice chat settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martino-dot/martino-dot.github.io/main/unknown.png)
* Here you can mute your mic, turn voice chat off, turn off icons (recommended, click on the eye icon), and settings and groups.
* Click on `Settings`
* Click on the `Activation type` button until it shows `Activation type: Voice`
* Set `Voice activation threshold` to something like `-70 dB` (You can change this depending on your environment)
* (Optional) If your default mic is different than the one you want to use with voice chat then click on `Select Microphone`. From there select which mic you want (Make sure to click `Select` once you've changed this, otherwise it won't work)
### Additional information
* You can install the datapacks that we use on the server on your own world. [Mediafire link](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/q8o1qptgh6mgs/Gog_Origins_DataPacks)
  * We use the Artic Fox datapack which you have to unzip. [Datapack](https://www.mediafire.com/file/wkzai9z6fzp8te2/Arctic_Fox.zip/file)
  * Starborne, witherhearted, axolotl, and bumblebee origins are currently not being used from the mediafire link. Instead, [use this download link](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/763576666705625108/861595236790566963/star_bee_axolotl_wither.zip) to get the four listed datapacks.
* These are all the mods we use:
  * Origins (1.0.0)
  * Extraorigins (1.17-1)
  * Fabric API (0.35.2+1.17)
  * Origins classes (1.2.1)
  * Pehkui (2.2.1)
  * Simple voice chat (1.1.2)
  * FabricSit (1.5.1)
  * Image2Map (Custom build)
* Simple voice chat is not required, but is recommended for better immersion and more funnies.
* If any information here is wrong, or you have a problem playing GOS, @moderator in the Gos Origins SMP Discord Server.
# Rules

* Don't enter the end (you can still loot strongholds if you find one, don't activate end portals)
* Don't be an asshole (don't grief if you know it's going to make someone else feel bad, pranks are allowed because funni)
